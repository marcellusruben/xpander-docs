## About Tableau

Tableau is a visual analytics platform that empowers individuals and organizations to explore and understand data through interactive visualizations.

Key features include:

- **Interactive Data Visualization**: Drag-and-drop interface to create dashboards, charts, graphs, and maps without coding.

- **Wide Data Connectivity**: Connects to multiple data sources such as Relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle), cloud services (Google BigQuery, AWS Redshift, Snowflake), spreadsheets (Excel, CSV, Google Sheets), and web connectors (APIs).

- **Geospatial & Mapping Capabilities**: Built-in geocoding and mapping for creating geographic visualizations.

- **Natural Language & AI Features**: Natural language queries for instant insights and AI-driven explanations of outliers and patterns.

- **Dashboard Interactivity**: Filters, actions, and parameters for interactive dashboards.

    4. Click on your profile icon at the top right of your account dashboard, and click on **My Account Settings**.

    5. In the **Settings** tab, find a section called **Personal Access Tokens**. Next, give your personal access token a name and click on **Create token** button.

    6. Copy your personal access token somewhere before closing the dialog box.
    7. Next, obtain authentication token by executing the following request:

    ```
    curl -X POST "https://{YOUR_SERVER_NAME}/api/3.26/auth/signin" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
    "credentials": {
        "personalAccessTokenName": "YOUR_PAT_NAME",
        "personalAccessTokenSecret": "YOUR_PAT_SECRET",
        "site": {
        "contentUrl": "YOUR_SITE_NAME"
        }
    }
    }'
    ```
    Fill the personalAccessTokenName and personalAccessTokenSecret with the personal access token name and the secret token you just obtained from the previous section.

    Meanwhile, you can check your server name as well as your site name in the URL of your Tableau account. For example, let's say the URL is https://dub01.online.tableau.com/#/site/xpandersandbox2-577b145t/, then:
    - server name: dub01.online.tableau.com
    - site name: xpandersandbox2-577b145t

    8. Save the authentication token you obtained somewhere safe.


    ### Integrate Tableau into xpander.ai

    4. Enter a **connector name**, e.g., "xpander-tableau". 
    5. Choose **Integration User** as the authentication scope.   
    6. Select **API Key** as the authentication mode.  
    7. Paste your Tableau authentication token into the provided field.  
    8. Set the **Auth Type** to **Custom**.  
    9. Write **X-Tableau-Auth** as the custom header name.
    10. Under **Interface specific settings**, enter the base URL: `https://{server}/api/{api-version}`. Replace **{server}** with the server name of your Tableau account and **{api-version}** with the API version, such as 3.26.

## AI Agent Tableau Prompt Library

Below are possible prompts or use cases you can try after integrating Tableau into your xpander AI agent:

Can you get me the usage statistics for this {content_type} with ID {content_item_id} so I can analyze how frequently it's being accessed?
```

````
Can you show me all the sites available in our Tableau environment and their configuration details?
````

```
Can you retrieve the current data for metric {metric_id} in site {site_id} to analyze recent performance trends?
```
