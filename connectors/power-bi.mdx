## About Power BI

Power BI is Microsoft's cloud-based business intelligence (BI) platform that enables users to connect to a wide range of data sources, transform and model data, and create rich visual reports and dashboards.

Key features include:

- **Data connectivity**: Connect to 100+ data sources including Excel, SQL, Azure, Google BigQuery, Snowflake, Salesforce, PDFs, and more.

- **Power Query**: Integrated ETL engine (also in Excel/Dataflows) to clean, transform, and mash up data using M‑code.

- **Data modeling with DAX**: Use Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to build measures, calculated columns, dynamic filters, and power calculations.

- **Visualizatio**: Drag‑and‑drop visuals, custom visuals via Marketplace, interactive dashboards, report page, Q&A (natural‑language querying), paginated reports, goals/KPI tracking.

## Authentication Options

Below are possible authentication options you can choose:

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Built-in xpander.ai Auth">

    The simplest way to connect Power BI is by using xpander.ai's built-in authentication:

    1. Go to the **Connectors** section in the sidebar of your xpander.ai dashboard.  
    2. Select **Power BI** from the available integrations.  
    3. Click **Sign in with Power BI**.  
    4. Grant xpander.ai permission to access your account.  
    5. Your Power BI integration is now ready to use.

  <Tab title="API Access">

    ### Generate a Power BI API Token

    1. Log in to [your Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/). 
    2. We need to create and register an app to access Power BI API. Therefore, in the sidebar of your Azure portal, select **Microsoft Entra ID**.

    ![Img 1](/images/connectors/power-bi/img_1.png)

    3. In the sidebar, Under **Manage** section, select **App registrations** and then click on **New Registration**

    ![Img 2](/images/connectors/power-bi/img_2.png)

    4. Give the app a name and choose one of the options under **Supported account types** that supports your use case. Next, click **Register**

    5. Once you created an app, you'll get the app credentials such as client ID and tenant ID. You'll need these credentials to get an access token later on.

    6. In the sidebar of **Microsoft Entra ID**, under **Manage** section, click on **App registrations**. Next, click on **All applications** tab and select your newly created app.

    7. In the sidebar, under **Manage** section, select **Certificates & secrets**, and then click on **New client secret**. Save the secret value somewhere safe.

    ![Img 4](/images/connectors/power-bi/img_4.png)

    8. Next, make sure that your app doesn't have any admin-consent required permissions. You can follow the steps mentioned in [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/admin/enable-service-principal-admin-apis#how-to-check-if-your-app-has-admin-consent-required-permissions) to do this.

    9. Go to your Power BI account, and then follow the instruction mentioned in the step 3 of [this Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/embedded/embed-service-principal?tabs=azure-portal#step-3---enable-the-power-bi-service-admin-settings).

    10. Go to the dashboard of your desired Power BI workspace, and under **Manage access**, add your newly created app as a member or admin by typing its name in the provided search bar.

    ![Img 5](/images/connectors/power-bi/img_5.png)

    11. Finally, obtain your access token by executing the following request:
    ```
    curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
    -d "grant_type=client_credentials" \
    -d "client_id=<YOUR_APP_CLIENT_ID>" \
    -d "client_secret=<YOUR_SECRET_VALUE>" \
    -d "scope=https://analysis.windows.net/powerbi/api/.default" \
    https://login.microsoftonline.com/<YOUR_APP_TENANT_ID>/oauth2/v2.0/token
    ```    

    Replace the placeholders above with credentials you obtained from previous steps. Save the access token that you get somewhere safe.

    ### Integrate Power BI into xpander.ai

    1. In your xpander.ai dashboard, go to the **Connectors** section in the sidebar.  
    2. Select **Power BI** from the available integrations.  
    3. Click **Other auth options**.  
    4. Enter a **connector name**, e.g., "xpander-power-bi".  
    5. Choose **Integration User** as the authentication scope. 
    6. Select **API Key** as the authentication mode.   
    7. Paste your Power BI access token into the provided field.  
    8. Set the **Auth Type** to **Bearer**.  
    9. Save the configuration.

## Integration of Power BI into AI Agent

Once you've configured your Power BI account with the authentication option(s) described above, you can integrate it into your AI agent with xpander.ai:

1. Select **Tools** in the Agent configuration tab of your xpander.ai dashboard, and then  click on **Add tools**.  
2. Select **Connectors**.  
3. Choose **Power BI** with the same **connector name** you configured in the previous section (e.g., xpander-power-bi).  
4. Select the available Power BI operations that suit your use case.

## Expose Power BI as MCP Server

Alternatively, you can also expose your Power BI account as an MCP server. To do so:

1. Go to the **Connectors** section in the sidebar of your xpander.ai dashboard.  
2. Select **Power BI** with the same **connector name** you configured in the previous section (e.g., xpander-power-bi).  
3. Click **MCP Configuration**.  
4. Enter the MCP configuration into the appropriate settings of the client app you want to use (e.g., Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop, etc.).
